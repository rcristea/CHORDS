# CHORDS
CHORDS is my very first passion project while studying Computer Science in college. The app was created to help me learn
how to play guitar by building chord progressions and showing me what the finger positions are for the chords.

Still in progress.

## Features
1. Add any chord to the main editor screen
2. Clear all chords from the editor screen
3. Click and drag chords to arrange them in a different location.
## Future Features
